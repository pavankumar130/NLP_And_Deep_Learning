## ðŸ“š Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. The goal is for computers to process, understand, and generate human language in a valuable way.

### Topics

1.  **Tokenization**: The process of breaking down a text into smaller units called **tokens**. It is the first step in most NLP pipelines, structuring raw text for further analysis. For example, "I love NLP." might be tokenized into `['I', 'love', 'NLP', '.']`.

2.  **Stemming**: A technique that reduces words to their **root or base form** by simply chopping off suffixes. For instance, "running," "runs," and "ran" might all be reduced to the stem "run." This process is generally less precise than lemmatization.

3.  **Lemmatization**: A more sophisticated technique that reduces words to their **lemma**, which is the dictionary or canonical form of a word. It uses vocabulary and morphological analysis to ensure the resulting root is a valid word. For example, "better" would be lemmatized to "good."

4.  **Stopwords**: Common words that carry little significant meaning and can be filtered out to improve NLP model performance. Examples include "the," "a," "an," and "is." Removing them helps reduce noise and focuses on more important terms.

5.  **Bag of Words (BoW)**: A simple model that represents text data by counting the occurrence of words within a document. It creates a vocabulary of unique words and then represents each document as a vector showing the frequency of each word. It ignores grammar and word order but focuses on word frequency.

6.  **TF-IDF**: **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency** is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection. It assigns higher weight to words that appear frequently in a specific document but are rare across the entire set of documents.

7.  **Word2Vec**: A popular technique for learning **word embeddings**, which represents words as dense, real-valued vectors. Words with similar meanings are located closer to each other in this vector space. It has two main architectures: **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)** and **Skip-gram**.

8.  **AvgWord2Vec**: A method for creating document-level representations by taking the average of the Word2Vec vectors for all the words in a document. This results in a single vector that represents the entire document.

## ðŸ¤– Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to learn from data. It is highly effective for complex tasks like image recognition and advanced NLP.

### Topics

1.  **Introduction to Deep Learning**: Deep learning involves neural networks with multiple layers between the input and output layers. These networks can automatically discover intricate features and representations from raw data, which is a major advantage over traditional machine learning methods.

2.  **Activation Functions**: These functions introduce non-linearity into a neural network, allowing it to learn complex patterns. An activation function determines whether a neuron should be activated. Common examples include **ReLU**, **Sigmoid**, and **tanh**.

3.  **Loss Function**: Also known as a cost function, it measures how well a model's predictions align with the actual data. The primary goal of training a deep learning model is to minimize this loss. Examples include **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for regression and **Cross-Entropy** for classification.

4.  **Optimizers**: An algorithm that adjusts the neural network's attributes, such as weights and learning rate, to reduce the loss. It guides the training process to find the optimal set of weights. Popular optimizers include **Adam**, **SGD**, and **RMSprop**.

5.  **Weight Initialization Techniques**: The process of setting the initial values of the weights in a neural network. Proper initialization is crucial because it can significantly affect training speed and help the network converge to a good solution. Poor initialization can lead to problems like exploding or vanishing gradients.

6.  **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: A foundational model in deep learning, ANNs are inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. ANNs are general-purpose and can be used for a wide range of tasks, from classification to regression.

7.  **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Specifically designed for processing data with a grid-like topology, such as images. CNNs use **convolutional layers** to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input data. They've revolutionized computer vision tasks like image classification and object detection. 

8.  **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Designed to handle sequential data, like text or time series. RNNs have a "memory" that allows them to use information from previous steps in a sequence to influence the current output. This makes them ideal for tasks like natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine translation.
